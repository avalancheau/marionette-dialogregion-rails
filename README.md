NOT SUPPORTED
=============

Using ad-hoc Ruby gems to wrap front-end assets is not a good idea.

This gem will no longer be updated; you should include the [JavaScript library](https://github.com/avalancheau/marionette-dialogregion) directly or via [Bower](http://bower.io/).

For a simple way of including Bower packages in Rails via the asset pipeline, check out [rails-assets](http://rails-assets.org/).
